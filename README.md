# NFL-Scraper

This Python script scrapes yearly NFL results from Pro-Football-Reference.com and converts points scored and spreads to normalized variables. The amount of points scored by the winning team and losing team are converted to Z scores, while the spread for each matchup is assigned a percentile based on the distribution of spreads for that year.

For those of you new to Python, I'd suggest downloading Anaconda and opening the "NFL Results Scraper.py" file in Spyder(https://www.spyder-ide.org/).

Once you have the file open in Spyder, you can easily run the file by pressing F5 (if you're using a Mac, hold the 'fn' key and press F5).
