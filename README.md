# NFL-Scraper

This script allows you to scrape NFL Results from Pro Football Reference and converts an NFL team's points scored to a performanced-based Z score using the distribution of points scored by winning or losing teams that year.

In order to scrape specific years, please specify the ranges within the file:

"for year in range(2012, 2018):"

Keep in mind this means that 2012â€“2017 will be included, but not 2018.

I'm new to programming, so any suggestions on improving the code are appreciated.
