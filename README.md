# NFL-Scraper

This Python script scrapes yearly NFL results from Pro-Football-Reference.com and converts points scored and spreads to normalized variables. The amount of points scored by the winning team and losing team are converted to Z scores, while the spread for each matchup is assigned a percentile based on the distribution of spreads for that year.
